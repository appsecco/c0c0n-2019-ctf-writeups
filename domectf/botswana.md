# Botswana - The rules!!

## Solution

* The challenge says "Make sure you follow the rules. The rules tell a different story."
* Looking at the rules sheet provided by the organisers, we noticed that there is a QR code
* The QR code points to a text file as Github gist `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anees264/90af6d6e6b80c65b18a15e7c0dd769bd/raw/eb0bdcbf19368d9dc4ed66450816ca4314e88dd4/the_rules.txt`
* The contents of the text file looks like a RegEx pattern
* Upon further inspection we identified that it is a code snippet written in an esoteric programming language called Malbolge
* We used an online Malbolge interpreter to execute the code and the output is the flag
